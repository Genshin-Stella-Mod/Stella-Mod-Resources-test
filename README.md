The Chinese version (YuanShen) is also supported.
More information is available in the [official documentation](https://sefinek.net/genshin-impact-reshade/docs?page=introduction).

### I'm using Genshin Stella Mod. Where are the resources located on my computer?
Resources are by default downloaded and updated in the `C:\Stella-Mod-Resources` directory. Users have the option to change the folder. It is recommended that resources be present on a faster SSD drive.
